            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>We have a dedicated staff of 15 (half are part-time). And our 200-plus volunteers are our backbone (thank you volunteers and donors!). Many of the rescued animals who come to Pets to Go get more love and attention in our shelter than they’ve ever known before. Our shelter continues to grow and improve. Drop by and get to know us better!</p>

                <h2>Our Mission and Our Solution</h2>
                <p>Because of tough economic times, fewer people can afford to keep their pets. So the number of homeless animals in and around Springfield is increasing dramatically. Pets to Go is a nonprofit, no-kill animal shelter serving the Springfield area. Our mission is to give these homeless animals a second chance through our rescue, shelter, and adoption programs.</p>

                <h2>A Brief History of Pets To Go</h2>
                <p>We were founded in 1990 with a few simple goals: save and place cats and dogs in new homes, and educate the public about spaying and neutering their pets.</p>
                <p>We’re now one of the largest no-kill shelters in the state! Each year, Pets to Go helps more than 1,300 cats and dogs find permanent homes. In total Pets to Go has placed an estimated 18,000 homeless cats and dogs in new households. Where do these animals come from? 40% are owner surrenders and the other 60% are animals we rescue from shelters that euthanize.</p>

                <h2>What We Offer For Help, That Others Won't</h2>
                <p>Pets to Go retrains animals with behavioral problems to be better companions in their new homes. And after the adoption, we’re here to help with behavior consultations, training classes, and more.</p>

                <h2>A Preventative Longterm Solution</h2>
                <p>Spaying or neutering your pet is the best way to stop the flood of homeless animals in Springfield. Our modern spay and neuter clinic has a top-notch professional team.</p>

                <h2>Take a Chance at Adoption</h2>
                <img src="../Final Project/Images/Adopt_About_Page.jpg" alt="A potential Adoptee, playing with potential pets" class="flex-image">
                <p>Our animals come from overcrowded area shelters, local families that can no longer care for their dog or cat, and rescue groups throughout the state. We give homeless, abandoned, and sometimes abused animals a second chance at a healthy, happy life with a caring guardian.</p>
